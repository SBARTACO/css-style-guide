## 1. General principles

> "Part of being a good steward to a successful project is realizing that
> writing code for yourself is a Bad Ideaâ„¢. If thousands of people are using
> your code, then write your code for maximum clarity, not your personal
> preference of how to get clever within the spec." - Idan Gazit

* You are not a human code compiler/compressor, so don't try to be one.
* All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no
  matter how many people contributed.
* Strictly enforce the agreed-upon style.
* If in doubt when deciding upon a style, use existing, common patterns.

<a name="whitespace"></a>
## 2. Whitespace

Only one style should exist across the entire source of your code-base. Always
be consistent in your use of whitespace. Use whitespace to improve
readability.

* _Never_ mix spaces and tabs for indentation.
* Use soft indents (spaces).
* Use 2 characters per indentation level

Tip: configure your editor to "show invisibles". This will allow you to
eliminate end-of-line whitespace, eliminate unintended blank-line whitespace,
and avoid polluting commits.

Tip: use an [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file (or equivalent) to
help maintain the basic whitespace conventions that have been agreed for your
code-base.


<a name="comments"></a>
## 3. Comments

Well commented code is extremely important. Take time to describe components,
how they work, their limitations, and the way they are constructed. Don't leave
others in the team guessing as to the purpose of uncommon or non-obvious
code.

Comment style should be simple and consistent within a single code base.

* Place comments on a new line above their subject.
* Keep line-length to a sensible maximum, e.g., 80 columns.
* Make liberal use of comments to break CSS code into discrete sections.
* Use "sentence case" comments and consistent text indentation.

Note that all the CSS in the death_star is written in SASS and so mostly
we use the alternative comment syntax. CSS comments can still be used
for purposes of development, licences or similar.

Tip: configure your editor to provide you with shortcuts to output agreed-upon
comment patterns.

Example:

```scss

//@ Section, 40 slashes
//////////////////////////////////////// ->

//^ Sub-section, 20 slashes
//////////////////// ->

//
// Title of long comment
//
// The first sentence of the long description starts here and continues on this
// line for a while finally concluding here at the end of this paragraph.
//
// The long description is ideal for more detailed explanations and
// documentation. It can include example HTML, URLs, or any other information
// that is deemed necessary or useful.
//
// @tag This is a tag named 'tag'
//

// Basic comment
```


```css
/**
 * Short description using Doxygen-style comment format
 *
 * The first sentence of the long description starts here and continues on this
 * line for a while finally concluding here at the end of this paragraph.
 *
 * The long description is ideal for more detailed explanations and
 * documentation. It can include example HTML, URLs, or any other information
 * that is deemed necessary or useful.
 *
 * @tag This is a tag named 'tag'
 *
 */

/* Basic comment */
```

<a name="format"></a>
## 4. Format

The chosen code format must ensure that code is: easy to read; easy to clearly
comment; minimizes the chance of accidentally introducing errors; and results
in useful diffs and blames.

* Use one discrete selector per line in multi-selector rulesets.
* Include a single space before the opening brace of a ruleset.
* Include one declaration per line in a declaration block.
* Use one level of indentation for each declaration.
* Use lowercase and shorthand hex values, e.g., `#aaa`.
* Use hex values for colors. If rgba is needed provide a fallback in rgba and
a comment with the hex value. This is done so it is easier to remove these
declarations in the future.
* Use double quotes consistently.
* Quote attribute values in selectors, e.g., `input[type="checkbox"]`.
* _Where allowed_, avoid specifying units for zero-values, e.g., `margin: 0`.
* Include a space after each comma in comma-separated property or function
  values.
* Include a semi-colon at the end of the last declaration in a declaration
  block.
* Place the closing brace of a ruleset in the same column as the first
  character of the ruleset.
* Separate each ruleset by a blank line.

```scss
.selector-1,
.selector-2,
.selector-3[type="text"] {
  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
  -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: block;
  font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
  background: #fff;
  background: linear-gradient(#fff, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8));
}

.selector-a,
.selector-b {
  padding: 10px;
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); // #000
}
```

#### Declaration order

If faced with a selector with a large number of properites consider
breaking them up by category. This can differ widely from selector to selector,
but always good candidates are positioning, box-model and colors.

A usual case

```scss
.selector {
  // Positioning
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 10;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;

  // Display & Box Model
  display: inline-block;
  overflow: hidden;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 10px solid #333;
  margin: 10px;

  // Other
  background: #000;
  color: #fff;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 16px;
  text-align: right;
}
```

#### Exceptions and slight deviations

Single declarations with up to 3 properties can use a slightly different,
single-line format. In this case, a space should be included after the opening
brace and before the closing brace.

```css
.selector-1 { width: 10%; }
.selector-2 { width: 20%; }
.selector-3 { width: 30%; }
```

Long, comma-separated property values - such as collections of gradients or
shadows - can be arranged across multiple lines in an effort to improve
readability and produce more useful diffs.

```css
.selector {
    background-image:
        linear-gradient(#fff, #ccc),
        linear-gradient(#f3c, #4ec);
    box-shadow:
        1px 1px 1px #000,
        2px 2px 1px 1px #ccc inset;
}
```

### SASS

* Limit nesting to 1 level deep. Reassess any nesting more than 2 levels deep.
  This prevents overly-specific CSS selectors.
* Avoid large numbers of nested rules. Break them up when readability starts to
  be affected. Preference to avoid nesting that spreads over more than 20
  lines.
* Always place `@extend` statements on the first lines of a declaration
  block.
* Where possible, group `@include` statements at the top of a declaration
  block, after any `@extend` statements.
* Consider prefixing custom functions with `x-` or another namespace. This
  helps to avoid any potential to confuse your function with a native CSS
  function, or to clash with functions from libraries.

```scss
.selector-1 {
  @extend .other-rule;
  @include clearfix();
  @include box-sizing(border-box);
  width: x-grid-unit(1);
  // other declarations
}
```


<a name="example"></a>
## 5. Practical example

An example of various conventions.

```scss

//@ Grid layout
//////////////////////////////////////// ->

//
// Column layout with horizontal scroll.
//
// This creates a single row of full-height, non-wrapping columns that can
// be browsed horizontally within their parent.
//
// Example HTML:
//
// <div class="grid">
//     <div class="cell cell-3"></div>
//     <div class="cell cell-3"></div>
//     <div class="cell cell-3"></div>
// </div>
//

//
// Grid container
// Must only contain `.cell` children.
//

.grid {
    height: 100%;
    // Remove inter-cell whitespace
    font-size: 0;
    // Prevent inline-block cells wrapping
    white-space: nowrap;
}

//
// Grid cells
// No explicit width by default. Extend with `.cell-n` classes.
//

.cell {
  position: relative;
  display: inline-block;
  overflow: hidden;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  height: 100%;
  // Set the inter-cell spacing
  padding: 0 10px;
  border: 2px solid #333;
  vertical-align: top;
  // Reset white-space
  white-space: normal;
  // Reset font-size
  font-size: 16px;
}

// Cell states

.cell.is-animating { background-color: #fffdec; }

//^ Cell dimensions
//////////////////// ->

.cell-1 { width: 10%; }
.cell-2 { width: 20%; }
.cell-3 { width: 30%; }
.cell-4 { width: 40%; }
.cell-5 { width: 50%; }

//^ Cell modifiers
//////////////////// ->

.cell--detail,
.cell--important {
    border-width: 4px;
}
```
